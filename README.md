# MTF Algorithm Implementation üî¢ üñ•Ô∏è
This repository contains Python code implementing the Move-To-Front (MTF) algorithm and its improved version, the Improved Move-To-Front (IMTF) algorithm. These algorithms are commonly used in managing linked lists, particularly for optimizing access patterns.

Feel free to add more test cases!

## Features
- **Node Class**: Defines a basic node structure for linked lists.
- **MTF Algorithm**: Implements the Move-To-Front algorithm, which reorganizes elements in a linked list.
- **IMTF Algorithm**: Implements the Improved Move-To-Front algorithm, which enhances MTF by considering future accesses when deciding whether to move an element to the front.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run `python main.py` to execute the test cases and see the algorithms in action.

## How to Run
- The `mtf_algorithm.py` file contains the implementation of both algorithms.
- Example usage and test cases are provided in the `main.py` file.
- Test cases cover scenarios like best-case, worst-case, and specific access patterns to demonstrate algorithm performance.
